## Allocating Raw Memory

Every developer knows the specific frustration of solving a complex, obscure technical problem—spending hours reading documentation and debugging segmentation faults—only to encounter the exact same problem six months later and realize they have completely forgotten the solution.

Human memory is volatile. It leaks. It gets overwritten.

I started Raw Memory to fix that.

## The Objective
This is not an attempt to reinvent the wheel or replace existing communities. The internet has plenty of tutorials and Q&A threads that serve their purposes well.

My goal here is different: I want to document my own path through the layers of computing that usually go unnoticed.

I am interested in the subjects that lie beneath the surface: the abstract concepts and low-level mechanics that many programmers rarely need to think about, but which govern everything we do. I want to explore these topics in a way that is highly technical yet comprehensible, bridging the gap between abstract theory and the raw reality of bits and bytes.

## The "Dump Log" Concept
I treat this space as a persistent core dump. It is a collection of my notes, code snippets, and investigations.

It is primarily a personal archiving way to preserve the state of my learning process before a context switch wipes it away. I am not trying to be a substitute for StackOverflow. However, if you stumble upon these logs while facing a similar obscure problem and find a solution that no other site provided, then this archive has served a double purpose.

## What to Expect
My focus is on the intersection of software and hardware, where abstractions start to leak. You can expect content on:

- **Deep Dives**: Exploring C internals, memory management, and the behavior of systems at a granular level.

- **Reverse Engineering**: Unpacking binaries to understand the logic that isn't visible in the source code.

- **Experiments**: From FPGA synthesis to kernel experiments, documenting the "what if" scenarios.

This blog is my documentation of that exploration. It allows me to express these problems in my own way, dissecting the "black box" to see how the machine actually ticks.

Welcome to **Raw Memory**.
